This is a list of projects that are made in the attempt to learn Xamarin and better my C# skills.

# Project 1
## Travel Record App
This project was made to learn Xamrin Forms. A user can sign in to record trips and experiences while the phone uses location data to display information about surrounding area. The app will then show you where to the location was on a map with a pin. The application uses the following features;
- Google Maps API
- FourSqure API
- Tabs
- Linq
- SQLite

I cannot claim that all code was orginal content from me. About 80% of the logic was original. The other 20% was contributed from a source, Eduardo Rosas who designed the project for an online course. My goal was to replicate his project without following his codealong. I refrenced his code when I had issues I could not find within available documentation. The next project needs to be entirly from scratch so there are no refrences. This will provide a more realistic professional environment. This was an awesome project for my first Xamarin App and look forward to more Xamarin projects in the future!

### To do List
- convert to MVVM architecture
- send code to azure
- transfer pictures to cloud
- change logic to pull from cloud instead of local

# Project 2
## in progress...
